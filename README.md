# Ansible-Training

This is my note at Ansible Training - Adinusa <br/>
<br/>
For trying my basic practice about Ansible, you can clone this repository and than you must active python virtual environment using this command
```bash
source python/bin/activate
```
<br/>
After that you can use it and try it by using ansible-playbook commands.
